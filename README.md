# Cryptography Lab - Assignment 3

## **Topic**: Cryptanalysis of m-Time Pad Cipher

### **Description**
This project analyzes a set of ciphertexts encrypted using an m-time pad (where m > 1), which reuses the same key across multiple messages, breaking the perfect secrecy of a one-time pad.

### **Objective**
- Identify which ciphertexts are encrypted with the same key.
- Use statistical analysis of XOR results to detect space characters in plaintext.

### **Hints Provided**
1. The plaintexts are written in English.
2. There are multiple sets of ciphertexts encrypted with the same key.

### **Usage**
Run:
```bash
python assignment3_mtimepad.py
